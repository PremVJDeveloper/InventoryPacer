Managing a curated online jewellery store requires consistency. Manually counting and ensuring a fixed mix of product types (like 10 pendants, 10 rings, 5 bracelets, and 5 earrings) is a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This inconsistency can lead to an unbalanced storefront, inefficient operations, and a diluted brand promise.
